# DRYing up code

In this practice exercise, you will demonstrate your mastery of the DRY
principle by cleaning up repetitive code logic.

You are given a function, `checkWin` which takes in a 3x3 array and returns an
'X' if there are three Xs in a row, 'O' if there are three Os in a row, 'T' if
there are no available moves and no winners, and `false` if there are no wins or
ties.

Run the code by typing `node ttt.js` and you will see that everything is working
as intended. Your task is to clean up the repetition to make the code more
readable and maintainable.
